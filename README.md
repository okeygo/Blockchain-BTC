# This backup was made September 26th, 2022 and is available upon request 
# by providing user and ip to proceed using the linux command 'scp'
# It takes around 100 minutes to receive both files and another 80 to uncompress 
# them.  Much better than waiting few days till IBD in a new full node

# It is better to do it by verifying blocks from Genesis but this copy is 
# intended to help those who would like to have a full node running as fast as possible
